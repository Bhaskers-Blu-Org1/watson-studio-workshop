Now that our project is ready to go, let's set it up!

## Download porject files
For this workshop, some files have been made available to simplify things a bit. Download the zip archive [here](https://github.com/IBM/watson-studio-workshop/archive/master.zip) or simply run 

`git clone git@github.com:IBM/watson-studio-workshop.git`

Included are 2 folders:
* `data`: a single CSV file which will act as our primary data source
    * A collection of historic home sales with various columns to describe the conditions
* `notebooks`: a pre-built notebook to train and deploy our models

# Add the data
From your project dashboard, click **Add to project**
