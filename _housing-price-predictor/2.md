# What is IBM Cloud?
IBM Cloud is a platform that provides developers with instant access to the services needed to develop and launch projects quickly, iterate continuously and scale with success. There are services available for mobile development, IoT, bare metal servers and storage solutions, as well as our suite of IBM Watson services. In other words, it's a marketplace with access to anything a developer could need to quickly get started building!
