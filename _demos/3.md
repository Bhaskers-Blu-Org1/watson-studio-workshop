[DEMO](https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/language-translator/#demo)

1. Open the demo above
1. Copy the text below
    ``` 
    We are uncovering better ways of developing
    software by doing it and helping others do it.
    Through this work we have come to value:

    Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
    Working software over comprehensive documentation
    Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
    Responding to change over following a plan

    That is, while there is value in the items on
    the right, we value the items on the left more.
    ```
