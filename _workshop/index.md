Data keeps on growing and deriving meaningful information out of that data is incredibly important. Using machine learning models from existing data helps to not only obtain useful insights, but also predict future results. In this workshop, we will walk through creating a machine learning model to predict the price of a home using Scikit-learn, trained inside of **Watson Studio** and deployed using the **Watson Machine Learning** service.

## Goals
After completing this workshop, you will:
1. Understand what Watson Studio is and the value it brings
1. Build simple 3 simple models
1. Understand the deployment pipeline using Watson Machine Learning

Let's get started!
